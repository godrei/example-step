title: Git Clone Repository
summary: Checks out the repository, updates submodules and exports git metadata as Step outputs.
description: |
  The checkout process depends on the Step settings and the build trigger parameters (coming from your git server).

  Depending on the conditions, the step can checkout:
  - the merged state of a Pull Request
  - the head of a Pull Request
  - a git tag
  - a specific commit on a branch
  - the head of a branch

  The Step also supports more advanced features, such as updating submodules and sparse checkouts.

  ### Configuring the Step

  The step should work with its default configuration if build triggers and webhooks are set up correctly.

  By default, the Step performs a shallow clone in most cases (fetching only the latest commit) to make the clone fast and efficient. If your workflow requires a deeper commit history, you can override this using the **Clone depth** input.
